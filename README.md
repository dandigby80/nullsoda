# NullSoda

NullSoda is a vaporwave-drenched toolkit for explorers of the digital frontier.
Inspired by cyberpunk aesthtics, underground hacking scenes, and old-school hacker spirit, NullSoda offers a growing suite of casual, creative network tools - built for learning, experimentation and pure tech mischief.

No corporations. No ads. Just code, caffeine and curiosity.

## Current Tools

- **Scanwave** - A lightweight network scanner, starting simple and evolving iver time.

(More tools coming soon... stay tuned!)

## Philosophy

NullSoda isn't about polished perfection or heavy enterprise bloat.
It's about building things *ourselves*, learning as we go, and having a good time doing it.

Expect ASCII art. Expect neon colours. Expect weird ideas.
All fueled by a love of tech and a refusal to take it too seriously.
